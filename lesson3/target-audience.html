      <h1>TARGET-AUDIENCE</h1>
      <h2>Who is the target audience?</h2>
      <p>
        TWith roots that date back to 1935, the Carbon County Chamber is a
        non-profit association that strives to be the indispensable resource for
        Carbon County businesses. Our Chamber is a voluntary organization of
        business owners, business people and citizens who are investing their
        time and money in a true community development program. We work together
        with the cities of East Carbon, Helper, Price, Wellington, along with
        Carbon County and the Carbon County Economic Development Department to
        improve the economic, civic, industrial and retail fortitude of the
        region, community, and the greater Caron County area. Any business
        leader or citizen who is interested in helping to develop the community
        is eligible to be a member of the Carbon County Chamber. The direct
        benefit is a stronger local economy, more businesses and more jobs with
        higher salaries and better benefits. The work of the chamber is financed
        by the investments of its members. The Chamber is guided by a group of
        13 Board of Directors who are business leaders in the area and represent
        a cross-section of our chamber membership. Active membership in your
        chamber carries with it a sense of accomplishment and pride from the
        knowledge that you are doing your share of an important job for the
        community. Every member has a voice in determining the policies and
        projects that the chamber undertakes. Chamber membership pays when our
        members become involved in helping us increase their exposure within the
        community, assist in building relationships with other members,
        providing referrals, and offering opportunities for our members to
        enhance their business. A great way to build your business is by helping
        to build your community.â€‹
